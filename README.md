# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Challenge Description
This challenge, assigned by Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, required the creation of an online timed coding quiz. The goal of this activity was to create a user interface that would allow a user to navigate through an online quiz with multiple questions and multiple choice options. The user would be able to select from the multiple choice options where the quiz would inform the user of correct/incorrect answers and keep track of their scores within a defined period of time.
